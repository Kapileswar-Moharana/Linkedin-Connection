# LinkedIn Connection Automation Script

This script is designed to automate the process of sending connection requests on LinkedIn. However, please note that using automation scripts to interact with online platforms might violate their terms of use and could lead to negative consequences for your account. Before using this script, it's important to consider the following:

## Disclaimer

**Usage of this script is at your own risk.** The creators of this script and the maintainers of this repository are not responsible for any negative outcomes, including but not limited to account suspension, restriction, or any other form of punitive action taken by LinkedIn.

## Purpose

The purpose of this script is to automate the process of sending connection requests on LinkedIn. It's essential to understand the potential ethical and legal implications of using automation scripts to interact with online platforms.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Respect for Others:** Automated actions, such as sending connection requests en masse, might be considered spammy behavior. This can negatively impact the LinkedIn experience for other users.

- **Informed Consent:** Connection requests should be sent only to individuals you genuinely know or have a professional reason to connect with. Mass-sending connection requests without personalization can be seen as intrusive.

## Usage

1. Ensure your LinkedIn account language is set to English.
2. Log in to your LinkedIn account.
3. Open the Chrome DevTools console on the "My Network" page: https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/
4. Paste the provided script into the console.
5. **Caution:** Running the script may result in account actions that violate LinkedIn's terms of use.

## Risk Mitigation

- **Limited Usage:** The script includes a limit of connection requests to be sent (LIMIT). Respect this limit to avoid excessive activity on your account.

- **User Discretion:** Before running the script, consider the potential consequences and whether the approach aligns with LinkedIn's policies and ethical standards.

## Alternatives

Instead of using automation scripts, consider these alternatives:

- **Manual Connections:** Personalize connection requests and send them manually to individuals you genuinely want to connect with.

- **LinkedIn Features:** Utilize LinkedIn's features, like searching for people with shared interests, joining relevant groups, and participating in discussions to make meaningful connections.

Remember that building a professional network is about quality, not quantity.
